  ### Dev Server

### Tests
- To run tests for this section, use `num run test`

## Instructions

For this assessment you will demonstrate your knowledge of React by completing a
simple calculator application.

The framework for this app has been provided for you as well. You will *_not_*
need to contribute any custom css or styling. 

- You may choose to build out EITHER the class component framework `CalcClass`
  or functional component framework utilizing hooks `CalcHook`
- Comment in ONLY the `export default` at the bottom of the page that
  corresponds to your chosen approach. Leaving both commented out or commented
  in simultaneously will result in a failed test.


- All code should be written in `./src/components/Calculator.js`
- When not displaying a number `input` and `display` values should be an empty
  string `''`
- `+` should be the default operator.
- If `Calculate` is attempted without 2 number inputs, `Select Two Numbers`
  should be rendered as an error message.
